# plot for rotation vs displacement

create plots for effect of rotation and displacement on Bx,By,Bz. Fix starting position of magnet and sensor.
This is to compare what the signals look like. see if there is any way to isolate the movement in each of them.

# "snr" plot
Show the effect of sensor positioning as a heatmap. color value = "snr" = (p2p of B when sweeping rotation)/(p2p of B when sweeping vertical position + p2p of B on other sensor).
Repeat for (sensor1, sensor2) x (Bx, By, Bz).
